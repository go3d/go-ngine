Cross-platform real-time OpenGL-based 3D engine in Go for Windows (Vista or newer), Linux (with *cough* decent graphics drivers *cough*) and Mac OS X (10.9 Mavericks or newer *only*).

Getting started via GLFW 3.x:
=============================

1. first, `go get github.com/go-gl/glfw3` --- this may not compile at first, until you have the http://glfw.org dev libs installed properly for your OS. **Note:** this `go-gl/glfw3` package **needs to be fully built/installed** in your `$GOPATH/pkg` before you can proceed!

2. Next,  `go get github.com/metaleap/go-opengl/core` --- my GoGL-inspired CGO wrapper for cross-platform "modern OpenGL" Core Profile . Compilation of this may well take some 10 seconds or longer, but this is a one-off cost. Again, this package **needs to be fully built/installed** in your `$GOPATH/pkg` before you can proceed!

3. Before finally diving into *go:ngine*, for now just try to build (via `go get`) and run **github.com/metaleap/go-opengl/cmd/opengl-minimal-app-glfw3/main.go** -- if this runs, *go:ngine*'s example apps should run, too.

4. Now, finally `go get github.com/metaleap/go-ngine/___old2013` should download and build everything else including dependencies.

Now you should be able to `go run` pretty much any `main.go` packages underneath `go3d/go-ngine/___old2013/_examples` -- note the programs need write access to the `go3d/go-ngine/___old2013/_examples/-app-data/_tmp` directory!


Getting started via GLFW 2.x:
=============================

Same as above, but

1. instead of `github.com/go-gl/glfw3` you use `github.com/go-gl/glfw`.

3. instead of `github.com/metaleap/go-opengl/cmd/opengl-minimal-app-glfw3/main.go` use `github.com/metaleap/go-opengl/cmd/opengl-minimal-app-glfw2/main.go`

4. before running any of the `go3d/go-ngine/___old2013/_examples`, swap the file extensions of `_examples/shared-utils/use-glfw3.go` and `_examples/shared-utils/use-glfw2.gtxt`


Getting started via SDL:
========================

Get someone to write a `CtxProvider` for SDL to be placed in `go-ngine/glctx/sdl`...  ;)


go:ngine
========

An ~~in-development~~ OpenGL-based "3D rendering engine" written in Go, focusing on interactive real-time apps such as games or demos.

Early ~~work-in-progress~~, and ~~progressing~~ at a rather leisurely pace too. Performance is a high priority, slowing development considerably. **Not really ready for any "production" use-cases just yet...**

Current state:

- parallel: while rendering the current frame N+0, *concurrently* (on multi-core) prepares rendering for the next frame N+1 *and* executes app logic for next-next frame N+2.
- renders a scene of textured primitive meshes such as cubes, pyramids, planes, quads, with multiple cameras and render-to-texture pipeline
- a single mesh can be reused by multiple "models" (differently textured), which can be reused by multiple "nodes" (essentially a potentially recursive hierarchy of transformations applied to a model in world space).
- cubemapped sky-mesh. Any mesh works in theory (try a sphere if you want a dome), tested so far cube and pyramid (which surprisingly looks just-as-good with a LOT less geometry...)
- Permutated fx-shaders / uber-shader system (fairly simple-minded for now)
- post-processing effects -- but only a few very simple ones implemented yet (gamma, grayscale...)
- per-face materials/effects
- multi-texturing (specifically, multiple fx of the same type in an effect)
- texture disk cache. Feed the go:ngine normal un-processed texture images -- it fetches instead from a temp dir (or creates in there only if missing) a file containing its equivalent, but readily pre-processed & re-aligned pixel data.
- new: batched rendering
- new: frustum culling

TODO:

- import/load actual 3D model assets (instead of the current pre-fab cubes, pyramids etc.)
- more cullings
- basic lighting models (per-vertex, per-pixel, deferred...)
- HDR (16-bit) pipeline, tone-mapping... but gonna need decent lighting (and shadows) first, obviously!

... you name it.
